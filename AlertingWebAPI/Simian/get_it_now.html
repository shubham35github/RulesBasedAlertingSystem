            <h3>Licensing</h3>
            <p>Simian is available with several licensing options depending on your intended use.</p>

            <p>Below is a summary of each type of license. You may, however, wish to read the full
            <a href="license.pdf">license agreement</a> which explains each particular type in greater detail.</p>

            <h3>Licences for Non-Commercial Projects and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>I am an active supporter of the free software and open source communities. As such, I provide a free
            license of Simian for non-commercial and open source use.</p>

            <p>Simian is also available for a period of 15 days for evaluation purposes.</p>

            <p>However, if you intend to use Simian commercially or within government, ie. you are not using Simian to check
            free software, I ask you to buy a license. I believe a Simian license represents excellent value for money,
            when compared to other products on the market today.</p>

            <h3>Personal/SOHO License</h3>
            <p>A Personal/SOHO License for Simian is US$99. A personal/SOHO license entitles you to use Simian on one
            machine only. A Personal/SOHO License does not permit the generation of reports for distribution nor use by
            other than the licensee. A Personal/SOHO License also entitles you to email support by sending mail to
            <a href="mailto:haruki_zaemon@mac.com">Simon Harris</a> and minor upgrades up to,
            but not including the next major version of the software.</p>

            <h3>Project/Build Server License</h3>
            <p>A project/build server license for Simian is US$499 and entitles you to use Simian on any number of
            machines solely for the licensed project, or on a single machine for many projects. A project license also entitles you to phone and email support by
            sending mail to <a href="mailto:haruki_zaemon@mac.com">Simon Harris</a> and
            minor upgrades up to, but not including the next major version of the software.</p>

            <h3>Enterprise and other Licenses</h3>
            <p>We also offer enterprise licensing for larger organisations where simple, per-project licensing is not
            appropriate. An Enterprise License entitles the licensee to use Simian on any number of machines
            across all locations and projects.<p>

            <p>If you are a consulting firm and wish to use Simian as part of your service offering or you or your
            organisation have some other use of Simian that is not specifically covered by one of the standard license
            agreements, I am more than happy to arrange a license agreement and pricing specific to your needs.</p>

            <p>For all licensing and sales related enquiries, please send emails directly to
            <a href="mailto:haruki_zaemon@mac.com;subject=Simian enquiry">Simon Harris</a>.</p>
